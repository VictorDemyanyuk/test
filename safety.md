# Safety Forms
Safety is a crucial part in our project and the following document explains the general safety procedures each team member had to follow.

# Team Safety
1. Hands should be washed upon entering and exiting the laboratory.

2. Eyes, mucous membranes, and any open cuts or wounds must be protected from contact with biohazard materials.

3. Eating or drinking in the laboratory is strictly prohibited.

4. Gloves and splash-proof goggles must be worn at all times.

5. Long or loose hair should be tied back.

6. All surfaces should be disinfected with 70% ethanol before beginning work.

7. Disposable tips, glassware, and tubes must be soaked in a 10% bleach solution for 20 minutes before being disposed of in regular waste.

8. Growth plates are to be discarded in a biohazard container, which will be autoclaved.

9. All equipment should be checked for proper working order, ensuring there are no cracks, chips, or damaged cords. Any issues should be reported immediately.

10. When pipetting, the pipette tip should not touch the sides of the container.

11. Tube caps should not be placed upside down; masking tape can be used to secure the bottom of the cabinet when necessary.

12. Work areas must be cleaned with 70% ethanol after work is completed.

13. All glassware and lab equipment should be cleaned and stored properly before leaving the lab.

14. Backpacks and stools must be placed to the side to ensure clear walkways.

15. Proper disposal procedures for laboratory materials must be known and followed at all times.
# Project Safety
1. Standard PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coats)

2. Use appropriately the biosafety cabinet to handle chemicals such as SYBR GOLD and DFHBI-1T

3. Use disposable pipette tips and ensure that all surfaces are decontaminated with 70% ethanol or a similar disinfectant before and after use.

4. When handling amplified nucleic acids, be aware of the risk of contamination between samples. Use separate pipettes for pre- and post-amplification areas to minimize contamination risk.

5. Autoclave or properly disinfect all materials that come into contact with amplified DNA or RNA.

6. Always ensure that the power supply is turned off and disconnected before handling the gel box, buffer solution, or any other electrophoresis apparatus.

7. Do not touch the buffer or gel while the electrophoresis system is running to avoid the risk of electric shock.

8. Regularly inspect the cables and power supply for signs of wear or damage to avoid electrical hazards.

9. Always use filtered pipette tips to avoid contamination, and change tips between samples to prevent cross-contamination.

10. Clearly label all reagents, samples, and gels to avoid confusion or accidental misuse.

11. If your detection system uses UV light for visualizing the nucleic acid bands, ensure that you use UV protective goggles or face shields to avoid eye damage.

12. Limit exposure to UV light by turning the UV transilluminator off when not in use.

# Human Practices and Education
All participants in Aptagenix provided the required consent forms from themselves or a legal guardian. Proper safety trainings ([FOBS 1+2](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/security-safety/formations/fobs-1-2/))  were provided by EPFL university prior to the beginning of the experiment.
